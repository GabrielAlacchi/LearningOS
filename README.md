# LearningOS

### Foreword

This is a simple stupid 64-bit OS and bootloader built for my own educational purposes. My goal is not to build a highly functional OS, I actually expect at some point that I'll run into a deadend where the time it will take to dig myself out will outweight my interest in continuing this project. Until then I hope to learn something valuable about ring 0 programming so that I may eventually acquire the skills necessary to start contributing to well established OS and systems level projects like the Linux kernel.
