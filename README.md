# LearningOS

### Foreword

This is a simple stupid 64-bit OS and bootloader built for my own educational purposes. My goal is not to build a highly functional OS, I actually expect at some point that I'll run into a deadend where the time it will take to dig myself out will outweight my interest in continuing this project. Until then I hope to learn something valuable about ring 0 programming so that I may eventually acquire the skills necessary to start contributing to well established OS and systems level projects like the Linux kernel.

### Credits

Credits to Gmarino2048 and other collaborators for this [tutorial](https://github.com/gmarino2048/64bit-os-tutorial) which was incredibly helpful when getting started with the bootloading and interrupts setup phase.

Credits to [OSDev Wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page), not sure what I'd do without it!
